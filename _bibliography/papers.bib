  title={Credit Assignment via Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity: Theoretical Frameworks},
  author={Cone, Ian, Clopath, Claudia and Costa, Rui Ponte},
  abstract={Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) is a form of synaptic plasticity in which dendritic Ca2+ plateau potentials in hippocampal pyramidal neurons drive rapid place field formation. Unlike traditional learning rules, BTSP learns correlations on the timescales of seconds and rapidly changes single-unit activity in only a few trials. To explore how BTSP-like learning can be integrated into network models, we propose a generalized BTSP rule (gBTSP), which we apply to unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, in both feedforward and recurrent networks. Unsupervised gBTSP mirrors classical frameworks of competitive learning, learning place field maps (in the feed-forward case), and attractive memory networks (in the recurrent case). For supervised learning, we show that plateau events can reduce task error, enabling gBTSP to solve tasks such as trajectory matching and delayed non-match-to-sample. However, we find that credit assignment via gBTSP becomes harder to achieve with increased network depth or CA3-like recurrence. This suggests that additional features may be needed to support BTSP-mediated few-shot learning of complex tasks in the hippocampus.},

  title={Learning to express reward prediction error-like dopaminergic activity requires plastic representations of time},
  author={Cone, Ian, Clopath, Claudia and Shouval, Harel},
  abstract={The dominant theoretical framework to account for reinforcement learning in the brain is temporal difference learning (TD) learning, whereby certain units signal reward prediction errors (RPE). The TD algorithm has been traditionally mapped onto the dopaminergic system, as firing properties of dopamine neurons can resemble RPEs. However, certain predictions of TD learning are inconsistent with experimental results, and previous implementations of the algorithm have made unscalable assumptions regarding stimulus-specific fixed temporal bases. We propose an alternate framework to describe dopamine signaling in the brain, FLEX (Flexibly Learned Errors in Expected Reward). In FLEX, dopamine release is similar, but not identical to RPE, leading to predictions that contrast to those of TD. While FLEX itself is a general theoretical framework, we describe a specific, biophysically plausible implementation, the results of which are consistent with a preponderance of both existing and reanalyzed experimental data.},

  title={Latent representations in hippocampal network model co-evolve with behavioral exploration of task structure},
  author={Cone, Ian and Clopath, Claudia},
  abstract={To successfully learn real-life behavioral tasks, animals must pair actions or decisions to the task’s complex structure, which can depend on abstract combinations of sensory stimuli and internal logic. The hippocampus is known to develop representations of this complex structure, forming a so-called “cognitive map”. However, the precise biophysical mechanisms driving the emergence of task-relevant maps at the population level remain unclear. We propose a model in which plateau-based learning at the single cell level, combined with reinforcement learning in an agent, leads to latent representational structures codependently evolving with behavior in a task-specific manner. In agreement with recent experimental data, we show that the model successfully develops latent structures essential for task-solving (cue-dependent “splitters”) while excluding irrelevant ones. Finally, our model makes testable predictions concerning the co-dependent interactions between split representations and split behavioral policy during their evolution.},

  title={Behavioral Time Scale Plasticity of Place Fields: Mathematical Analysis},
  author={Cone, Ian and Shouval, Harel},
  abstract={Traditional synaptic plasticity experiments and models depend on tight temporal correlations between pre- and postsynaptic activity. These tight temporal correlations, on the order of tens of milliseconds, are incompatible with significantly longer behavioral time scales, and as such might not be able to account for plasticity induced by behavior. Indeed, recent findings in hippocampus suggest that rapid, bidirectional synaptic plasticity which modifies place fields in CA1 operates at behavioral time scales. These experimental results suggest that presynaptic activity generates synaptic eligibility traces both for potentiation and depression, which last on the order of seconds. These traces can be converted to changes in synaptic efficacies by the activation of an instructive signal that depends on naturally occurring or experimentally induced plateau potentials. We have developed a simple mathematical model that is consistent with these observations. This model can be fully analyzed to find the fixed points of induced place fields and how these fixed points depend on system parameters such as the size and shape of presynaptic place fields, the animal's velocity during induction, and the parameters of the plasticity rule. We also make predictions about the convergence time to these fixed points, both for induced and pre-existing place fields.},

  title={Learning precise spatiotemporal sequences via biophysically realistic learning rules in a modular, spiking network},
  author={Cone, Ian and Shouval, Harel},
  abstract={Multiple brain regions are able to learn and express temporal sequences, and this functionality is an essential component of learning and memory. We propose a substrate for such representations via a network model that learns and recalls discrete sequences of variable order and duration. The model consists of a network of spiking neurons placed in a modular microcolumn based architecture. Learning is performed via a biophysically realistic learning rule that depends on synaptic ‘eligibility traces’. Before training, the network contains no memory of any particular sequence. After training, presentation of only the first element in that sequence is sufficient for the network to recall an entire learned representation of the sequence. An extended version of the model also demonstrates the ability to successfully learn and recall non-Markovian sequences. This model provides a possible framework for biologically plausible sequence learning and memory, in agreement with recent experimental results.},
